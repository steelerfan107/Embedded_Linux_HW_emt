Homework 02
ERIC TAYLOR

In this homework I created two programs, the first toggles 4 leds with 4 push buttons. The second one is an Etch-A-Sketch program controlled by push buttons.

HOW TO:

To Compile Push Button LED program:
gcc switches.c gpio-utils.c gpio-utils.h

To Run:
./a.out

To Compile Etch-a-Sketch Program:
gcc etch_a_sketch.c -lncurses gpio-utils.c gpio-utils.h

To Run:
./a.out <size of board>


HARDWARE (Had to use slightly differant pinout to account for not being able to change pullup/down):

PUSH BUTTONS ON
P9_11
P9_13
P9_15
P9_12

LEDS ON:
P9_21
P9_23
P9_27
P9_22
