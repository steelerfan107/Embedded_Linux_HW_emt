HOMEWORK 04 README

How to compile and run each program.

1.   a) This program uses two switches to toggle USR3 and USR1 using mmap
	to Compile: gcc mmap_switch.c
	to Run:     ./a.out			
	Uses Buttons: P9_11  and P9_13

     b) In this program I edited the mmap thru to use a switch instead to light up an LED 
	to compile: gcc gpioThru.c
	to Run:     ./a.out
	Uses Button:  P_11

2.   This program uses the two encoders to control the etch-a-sketch board over i2c
	to Compile: gcc etch_a_sketch.c i2cbusses.c i2cbusses.h gpio-utils.c gpio-utils.h i2c-dev.h
	to Run:     ./setup.sh
		    ./a.out

3.   This program edits the bone server to change both colors of the LED over the internet
	to Run    : cd ./server
		    ./boneServer.js
